# bytsizebio

## The goal of bytesizebio is to **make bioinformatics accesible to wetlab biologists**.

---

bytesizebio is a collection of short and simple bioinformatics tutorials.

- Video tutorials can be found on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR-VwpR0FCDkftWb4M1AeJg),
- Code and text tutorials can be found in the `Tutorials` tab,
- If you'd like to see a tutorial on a specific topic please <a href="https://forms.gle/cNeSPXgAhk7ufVtc6" class="external-link" target="_blank">suggest it here</a>.

**A note about the terminal**: While not required, some experience with the terminal will be useful. Don't get too caught up in the specifics as I try my best to cover everything needed in every tutorial. Additionally all of the code will be made available as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HnvsehuSw" class="external-link" target="_blank">Google Colab</a> notebooks which can be run by anyone with a Google account for free without installing anything.
